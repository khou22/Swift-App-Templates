# Sample-Tab-Bar-Project
A sample Xcode project that demonstrates the various features and functions of the tab bar. Can serve as a template for future apps.

This app incorporates almost all the skills that I learned over the summer at Breathometer in 2016. I used these as a starting point at which to build off of. I will continue to build on it as I learn more.
